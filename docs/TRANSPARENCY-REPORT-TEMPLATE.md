## IPFS-Specific Considerations

### Content Removal Limitations

It's important to understand that:

1. **Content on IPFS is permanent**: Once published, content cannot be "deleted" from IPFS network
2. **We can only unpin**: We can stop hosting content, but others may continue hosting it
3. **CID remains valid**: The content identifier (CID) remains valid and accessible if anyone else hosts it
4. **No central authority**: IPFS has no central authority to enforce takedowns

### Our Policy

When we receive a legitimate takedown request:

1. We evaluate legal validity
2. We may unpin the content from our nodes
3. We document the request in this transparency report
4. We cannot guarantee content removal from the entire IPFS network
5. We may provide information to help requestor contact other hosts
